Sparse InversE Covariance estimation for Ecological Association and Statistical Inference

This package will be useful to anybody who wants to infer graphical models for all sorts of compositoinal data. Primarily intended for microbiome relative abundance data (generated from 16S-metagenomic sequence data). It also includes a generator for [overdispersed, zero inflated] multivariate, correlated count data.

This will is the resting place for developmental versions. For right now the documentation is sparse, but you can install it using the install_github function from the devtools package. I'll be filling out the documentation and writing vignettes in the coming weeks, and submitting it to CRAN.

thanks,
Zach
